The **CPU-Based Motion Frame Extractor** is a Google Colabâ€“ready project developed for detecting and saving only the frames from a video that contain motion, using the OpenCV library. 
This version is designed to operate entirely on the CPU, making it suitable for environments without access to GPU acceleration. The motion detection works by comparing pixel differences between consecutive frames to identify significant changes, which are then saved as individual images.
The notebook allows users to upload a video, processes it efficiently, displays a preview of the first few motion frames, measures the total time taken for processing, and offers the option to download all detected frames in a ZIP file. 
This CPU-based implementation provides a practical and accessible solution for motion-based video analysis, and in this project, it is used as a baseline for performance comparison with a GPU-accelerated version. 
The comparison focuses on key aspects such as processing speed, accuracy of detection, and system efficiency, helping to evaluate the trade-offs between CPU and GPU-based frame extraction techniques.
