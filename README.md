The **Motion Frame Extractor** is a Google Colabâ€“ready project that extracts only the frames containing movement from a video using OpenCV. 
It works by comparing consecutive frames, identifying changes, and saving only those with significant motion. The notebook allows users to upload a video, process it efficiently, and display the first few motion frames. 
It also measures the total time taken for processing and provides an option to download all saved frames as a ZIP file.
This tool is ideal for video analysis tasks where detecting and isolating motion is important. 
Future improvements could include GPU acceleration (CUDA), keyframe summarization, and real-time webcam support.
